            <h1>My Husband, Rodrick</h1>
            <p>My husband's name is Rodrick. He is the youngest of six children and he is the biggest sports fanatic I know. He played baseball and basketball growing up and in college, and he helps coach the teams that our son's play on. He works as a blow mold mechanic for a manufacturing company. </p>

            <h1>Me, Kellie</h1>
            <p>My name is Kellie. I have a sister that is 15 years younger than me. I treat her more like a niece/daughter, than a sibling, because of the age difference. I've owrked as a teacher for 8+ years and I love teaching and I love my students, but I do not like the baggage that comes with teaching and I ready to move on to the next chapter of my life. </p>

            <h1>My Oldest Daughter, Aeriel</h1>
            <p>My oldest daughter's name is Aeriel. She is 20 years old, and a Junior at UMKC, majoring in Business Finance. She continutes to amaze us, by doing really well with her school work and keeping her grades up. Aeriel is in an apartment for the first time this year, so she is really into learning to cook these days. She's been making meals and baking sweet treats for herself and her roomates this year. She also works from home part time, for Edward Jones, as part of a college internship. </p>

            <h1>My Oldest Son, Kai</h1>
            <p>My oldest son's name is Kai. He is 17 years old, and a Junior in high school. He currently attends school virtually and will not return to in-person instruction, until sometime next school year. I am hoping to get him vaccinated in time for him to attend his Senior year of high school in person. Kai loves gaming and football. He also enjoys building things. I have been trying to convince him to learn coding, because I think he would love it, but I am still working to convince him. </p>
